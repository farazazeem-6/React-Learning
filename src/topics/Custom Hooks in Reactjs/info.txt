What You Said
"Hook is nothing but a piece of code that we write so we can use it again and again."

‚úÖ This is mostly correct!

Hooks are reusable pieces of logic.
Instead of repeating the same state management or side effect code everywhere, you put it inside a hook and reuse it.
BUT... there is one key difference between hooks and components.






 Simple Analogy
Imagine you‚Äôre making cars üöó:

Component = The car body (visible thing)
It creates the UI that people see, like a steering wheel, seats, etc.
Example: A <Button /> component shows a button on screen.


Hook = The engine inside the car üîß
It does not appear on screen, but it powers the car with logic.
Example: useCounter() gives count state and increment logic, but doesn't display anything.









4. Example ‚Äî Showing Difference
‚ùå Wrong Thinking: Calling a Hook Like a Component
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <useCounter /> {/* ‚ùå You CANNOT do this */}
    </>
  );
}

Why ‚ùå?
Because a hook does not return JSX ‚Äî it just returns data/logic, not UI.







‚úÖ Correct Usage

                             Hook (useCounter.js):

import { useState } from "react";

export default function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }
  return { count, increment };
}


                             Component (Counter.jsx):

import React from "react";
import useCounter from "./useCounter";

export default function Counter() {
  const { count, increment } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Count: {count}</h3>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}


                             App.jsx:

import Counter from "./Counter";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Counter /> {/* ‚úÖ Component renders UI */}
    </>
  );
}

export default App;








5. Why They Aren‚Äôt the Same

Component = focuses on UI (what to show on screen).

Hook = focuses on logic (how things work behind the scenes).

Even though both can be reused, they serve different purposes:
Component is like the visible house üè†.
Hook is like the electricity system ‚ö° that powers the house ‚Äî invisible but necessary.






6. Final Definition (Beginner-Friendly)

A hook is a special type of reusable function in React that contains logic, not UI.
You use hooks inside components to manage things like state, fetching data, or timers.
Components display things on the screen, but hooks power the components by providing the behind-the-scenes logic.




7. Summary

Yes, hooks and components are both reusable code.

Difference:
Components ‚Üí return UI
Hooks ‚Üí return logic/data

You cannot directly render a hook, but you use it inside a component.
Hooks exist because logic reuse and UI reuse are two separate needs in React.
