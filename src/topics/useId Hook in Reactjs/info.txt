UseId() hook:

UseId() hook is use to generate a unique id .For example we loop over a list and you know that it gaves a suggestion error that every list should have a unique id so here we can use the UseId hook to generate a unique id.But always remember that using UseId hook in the list error is not recommneded in the documentation of React.

There are also many other things where we can use the UseId hook where we want to get a unique id.
For example we have a form and we have to connect the label with his related input so here we can use UseId to get a unique id . So now if we want to use that form multiple time then the UseId will generate a unique id always.In the code i have made a form and explain this point.
